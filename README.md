# Crime-Rate-Data-Pipeline
This project builds a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract Airbnb and crime datasets from Amazon S3. The data is cleaned and transformed using PySpark, aggregated with DuckDB, and visualized on an interactive dashboard. The analysis focuses on uncovering correlations between crime rates and Airbnb prices across neighborhoods in Los Angeles.
